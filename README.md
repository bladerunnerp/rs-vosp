# rust-vosp

A Very Opinionated Starting Point for Rust projects.

This is the basics:

- configuration through environment vars with defaults
- simple logging
- CLi module with one command to print the configuration to console as json

Just fork, clone, and start your own app using this as a foundation. (or don't, I made this for me)
